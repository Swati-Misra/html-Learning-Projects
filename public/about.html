<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Digital Marketing and Web Compliance Specialist with years of experience in various industries, including digital media outlets, advertising agencies, broadcast platforms, education, and healthIT sector. I am driven by growth, innovation, and multicultural experiences.</p>

<p>I view marketing with a consumer-first approach and digital marketing as social-first! I have helped shape the digital presence of local, non-profits, and government clients using innovative branding solutions, social media-specific strategies, data analysis, and lead generation through traditional and grassroots marketing initiatives. Additionally, I have led the web-compliance projects helping non-ADA compliant websites become more accessible and inclusive for people with disabilities. </p>

<p>Over the years, I have helped commercial clients generate higher ROI, and non-profits make a difference in society. I intend to continue this significant journey in new arenas with compassion, power, and solid leadership.</p>
